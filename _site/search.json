However, some areas could be improved. Some categories with 0% (e.g., “Communications business” and “Management consulting”) add unnecessary clutter and should be omitted. Labels are small and difficult to read, especially for categories like “Public service” and “Banking and investment.” Adding a title, clarifying vague categories like “Other service industries,” and including a data source would enhance context. Grouping smaller percentages into one category and using a legend could also simplify the chart and improve readability.\n\n\nAssignment 2\n\n\n\nR plot\n\n\n\n1 + 1\n\n[1] 2"
