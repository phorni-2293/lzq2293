critique of a chart
![chart](chartpic.png)
This pie chart provides a clear visual representation of employment or further study outcomes with diverse categories and distinct color coding. However, some areas could be improved. Some categories with 0% (e.g., “Communications business” and “Management consulting”) add unnecessary clutter and should be omitted. Labels are small and difficult to read, especially for categories like “Public service” and “Banking and investment.” Adding a title, clarifying vague categories like “Other service industries,” and including a data source would enhance context. Grouping smaller percentages into one category and using a legend could also simplify the chart and improve readability.
